Basic Concepts
==============
The code in this project may or maynot have been written by me. This is a project full of half projects I use as reference points. Some of the code may be from stackoverlows, goland google groups, emails, brainstorms, and other githib repos. 

This is a work in progress. Shoot, some of the files may be incomplete or non-functional. This project really is for me to share ideas with other folks and future-me. 

Go is Great
===========

Concurrancy

Multiple named returns
    * also, simpler returning from functions

Simplicity and efficiency over sugar

The notion of "Objects"

Compiled or interpreted

Byte manipulation

Rad for loops

Range

Closures!

Some real Programming language geeks talk about it, great stuff to read



Go is GREAT/STINKS
===================

Overloading
-----------
Doesn't exist. It turns out, it's not really that important. But I have to be reminded of this fact every once in a while

Single Compiled Binary

Pointers!

Interfaces!

Scoping

Type Inheritance -- nope

Staticly linked compiled packages! WOOOO!


Go Stinks
==========

Errors
------
Error handling in go is awkward at best. Strangely this has little to do with the fact that it lacks exceptions,
which is doesn't really lack, but more along the lines of this cursed beast:

if (err != nil) {
    // an error has occured
}

I hate negative logic


Bracketing
----------
Go's brackets get old pretty quick


Strange Casing
--------------
I think they're just being different
